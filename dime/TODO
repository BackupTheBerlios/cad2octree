TODO for DIME

Just to clarify something; the order of the items in the list and the
priority we have given the items do not guarantee when (or even if) the
items will be implemented.

 *) upgrade configure setup and and DLLify library - make Mac OS X framework
    [top priority]

 *) Write more and better doxygen documentation comments.
    [high priority]

 *) Make a more robust run-time type checking system.
    [high priority]
    - shouldn't require client apps to be recompiled if new types are added
    - maybe make it possible to override the "built-in" types
    - must be in place before v1.0

 *) Implement a (better) debug/warning/error system with callbacks
    [high priority]

 *) Implement more of the entities, tables, etc. used by AutoCAD
    [medium priority]

 *) implement some means of "seamless" integration with Coin
